üìå PROBLEM STATEMENT: Linear Regression to Predict Restaurant Profit

You're the CEO of a restaurant franchise looking to expand into new cities.
You already have profit data from 20 cities and their populations.

üéØ GOAL:
Build a simple machine learning model using **Linear Regression** to:
- Learn the relationship between a city's population and expected monthly profit.
- Predict profit for a new city given its population.

üë®‚Äçüíª WHAT YOU WILL BUILD:
- A machine learning model using **gradient descent** to minimize cost.
- A way to visualize both data and the fitted regression line.
- A predictor that can estimate profits for cities with different population sizes.
