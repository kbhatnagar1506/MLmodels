# 🧠 Krishna Bhatnagar’s Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal Machine Learning (ML) vault!  
This repository is a growing archive of my **projects, experiments, notes, and complete implementations** of machine learning models — all built from scratch or using modern ML frameworks.

## 🔥 Why This Repository Exists

- To document my **end-to-end ML learning journey** from beginner to advanced
- To **build and showcase real-world projects** (including deployments)
- To reinforce concepts by **implementing models manually**
- To **prepare for interviews, research, and Big Tech internships**
- To help others learn from my clean, well-commented code
